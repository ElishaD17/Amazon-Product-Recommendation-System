# Amazon Product Recommendation System

This project develops a machine learning-based recommendation system to enhance user engagement and improve product targeting on Amazon. It features a dual-platform analytics dashboard built using Power BI and Tableau to visualize key performance indicators and insights derived from user data.

## Overview

The Amazon Product Recommendation System utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to predict user preferences and recommend products. This system leverages user segmentation and sophisticated ad targeting algorithms to boost content virality and refine product targeting through real-time analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning model development.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Utilized for building and training advanced machine learning models.
- **Apache Spark**: Employed for handling large-scale data processing.
- **Power BI and Tableau**: Used for developing interactive, real-time dashboards to visualize results and insights.
- **Google Colab**: As the development environment to leverage free computational resources, including GPUs.

## Project Structure

- `/data`: This folder contains the dataset and any preprocessing scripts.
- `/models`: Includes scripts for model building and training.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model testing.
- `/dashboards`: Files related to dashboard development in Power BI and Tableau.
- `/docs`: Documentation files explaining the methodologies, results, and usage of the system.

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Setup instructions for each component are as follows:

1. **Python Environment Setup**:
   - Install necessary Python libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Apache Spark Setup**:
   - Follow the official guide to set up Spark on your machine or use it within Google Colab.

3. **Dashboard Tools**:
   - Install Power BI and Tableau desktop applications to access and use the dashboards provided.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Data preprocessing:
   - Execute the script `python preprocess_data.py` to prepare your data.
2. Model training:
   - Run `python train_model.py` to train the machine learning models.
3. Dashboard:
   - Open the provided files in Power BI and Tableau to explore the dashboards.
